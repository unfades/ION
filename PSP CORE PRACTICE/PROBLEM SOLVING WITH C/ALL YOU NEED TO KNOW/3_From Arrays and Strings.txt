An array is a collection of elements of the same type and a string is a sequence of characters. 

Arrays may be single dimensional or multidimensional. 

A multidimensional array is basically an array of arrays. 

Both arrays and strings allow indexed access to their elements. Elements in an array and characters in a string can be accessed using an index.
