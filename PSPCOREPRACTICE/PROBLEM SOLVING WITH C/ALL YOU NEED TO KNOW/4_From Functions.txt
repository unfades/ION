Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks, enhancing modularity and reusability. 

Functions in C are categorized into built-in and user-defined functions, which can take parameters and return values. 

Scope defines where a variable can be accessed (local, global, block), while lifetime determines how long it exists in memory (automatic, static, dynamic). 

Recursion involves a function calling itself, solving problems by breaking them into smaller instances, with a base case to stop the recursion.
